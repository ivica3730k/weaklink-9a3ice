"""Per-block pseudorandom bit interleaver: break up burst errors before Viterbi
and avoid periodic-noise alignment across blocks.

Viterbi is optimal for random errors and struggles with bursts (a deep fade
wipes a run of coded bits and the trellis can't recover). Interleaving spreads
a burst over many decode positions so errors look random again.

We use a per-block pseudorandom permutation of ``rows * cols`` bit positions,
seeded by the block index. TX and RX derive the same permutation from the
same seed; RX brute-forces a small window of candidate seeds per slot until
the CRC clears, so an occasional missed slot doesn't desync the whole stream.

Per-block variation matters against periodic man-made noise (SMPS, mains
harmonics, car chargers): with a fixed rectangular interleaver, a repeating
disturbance hits the same bit positions in every block and RS sees a
persistent error pattern. Randomising the permutation per block turns that
back into "random errors spread across the code."
